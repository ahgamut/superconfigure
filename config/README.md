# How does `superconfigure` build software?

This document explains how the software packages in `superconfigure` are built,
by providing some surrounding context for `config/common.mk`,
`config/functions.mk` and all the `BUILD.mk` files in the repo.  

Our general goal is to have a wrapper around the autotools-style build scripts
for software, so that we can build software with Cosmopolitan Libc, without
changing too much of the source code.Let's look at how that works when
building `bash`. 

## building `bash`

To build `bash` with Cosmopolitan Libc, we need to go through the following steps:

1. Download `bash` source
2. (possibly) Patch the source code to enable building with Cosmopolitan Libc
3. Confirm the dependencies for `bash` (`ncurses` and `readline`) have been
  installed
4. Configure, build, install for `x86_64`
5. Configure, build, install for `aarch64`
6. Use Cosmopolitan Libc's `apelink` to combine the `x86_64` and `aarch64` 
debug binaries to build a fat binary, and add necessary zip store assets.
7. now we should have a `bash` in `results/bin`

These steps need to occur in a specific order: 1, 2, 3, (4, 5 can occur
simultaneously), and then 6. We enforce this order via Makefile dependencies.
Thus the build steps for `bash`, expressed graphically, would look like:

![](./bash-deps.svg)

Thus to build bash from the root of the repo, we write `make
o/cli/bash/built.fat`.  Note that building `bash` requires `ncurses` and
`readline` to have already been installed, and this is also expressed as part of
the recipe: `o/cli/bash/deps.x86_64` needs `o/lib/ncurses/installed.x86_64` and
`o/lib/readline/installed.x86_64`, each of which require their own
`downloaded`/`patched`/`configured`/`built` steps. These steps are common to
every `BUILD.mk`, let's see how each of them work.

## General steps and defaults

From the image above, we note that building bash will have a recipe something
like with the following steps:

1. Download `bash` source

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/downloaded: DL_COMMAND = $(DL_DEFAULT)
o/cli/bash/downloaded: DL_FILE = 
```

`$(DL_DEFAULT)` calls a script wrapping `wget`, that downloads any `.tar.gz`,
`.tar.xz`, `.tar.bz2`, and `.zip` file. The command will fail if `$(DL_FILE)` is
not provided.

2. (possibly) Patch the source code to enable building with Cosmopolitan Libc

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/patched: o/cli/bash/downloaded
o/cli/bash/patched: PATCH_COMMAND = $(PATCH_DEFAULT)
o/cli/bash/patched: PATCH_FILE =
```

We ensure that patching happens only after the source has been downloaded.
`$(PATCH_DEFAULT)` calls a script wrapping `patch -p0 -i`, and `$(PATCH_FILE)`
is usually set to a `minimal.diff` file located next to a `BUILD.mk`. The
command will fail if `$(PATCH_FILE)` is not provided, but will exit without
error if the provided `$(PATCH_FILE)` doesn't exist.

3. Confirm the dependencies for `bash` (`ncurses` and `readline`) have been
  installed

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/deps.x86_64: o/cli/bash/patched o/lib/readline/installed.x86_64 o/lib/ncurses.installed.x86_64
o/cli/bash/deps.x86_64: DEPS_COMMAND = $(DEPS_DEFAULT)
```

`$(DEPS_DEFAULT)` is just an `echo ""`, this target usually is just to ensure
the dependencies have been installed correctly.

4. Configure, build, install for `x86_64`
5. Configure, build, install for `aarch64`

```Makefile
# similar for both x86_64 and aarch64
o/cli/bash/configured.aarch64: o/cli/bash/deps.aarch64
o/cli/bash/configured.aarch64: CONFIG_COMMAND = $(CONFIG_DEFAULT)
o/cli/bash/built.x86_64: o/cli/bash/configured.x86_64
o/cli/bash/built.x86_64: BUILD_COMMAND = $(BUILD_DEFAULT)
o/cli/bash/installed.aarch64: o/cli/bash/built.aarch64
o/cli/bash/installed.aarch64: INSTALL_COMMAND = $(INSTALL_DEFAULT)
```

`$(CONFIG_DEFAULT)` is a script that errors out -- every `BUILD.mk` must
override `CONFIG_COMMAND` one way or another.

`$(BUILD_DEFAULT)` is just `make -j$(MAXPROC)`.

`$(INSTALL_DEFAULT)` is just `make install -j$(MAXPROC)`.

6. Use Cosmopolitan Libc's `apelink` to combine the `x86_64` and `aarch64` 
debug binaries to build a fat binary, and add necessary zip store assets.

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/built.fat: FATTEN_COMMAND = $(APELINKPLS)
o/cli/bash/built.fat: BINS =
o/cli/bash/built.fat: o/cli/bash/installed.x86_64 o/cli/bash/installed.aarch64
```

`$(APELINKPLS)` is a script that wraps Cosmopolitan Libc's `apelink` binary, and
for each file `$EXE` in `BINS`, it creates a fat binary from
    `$COSMOS/x86_64/bin/$EXE` and `$COSMOS/aarch64/bin/$EXE`.

## Conveniences

For convenience, we have some functions implemented in `config/functions.mk` to
simplify writing some of the above steps. These are basically some form of text
substitution, and we invoke them as:

```Makefile
$(eval $(call FUNC_NAME,param1,param2))
```

We have 4 functions for now: `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE`, `SPECIFY_DEPS`,
`AUTOTOOLS_BUILD`, `CMAKE_BUILD`. These help out when the recipe has a lot of
dependencies.

Instead of writing:

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/downloaded: DL_FILE = https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.2.tar.gz
o/cli/bash/patched: PATCH_FILE = $(BASELOC)/cli/bash/minimal.diff
```

We can write:

```Makefile
BASH_SRC := https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.2.tar.gz 
$(eval $(call DOWNLOAD_SOURCE,cli/bash,$(BASH_SRC)))
```

Instead of writing:

```Makefile
o/cli/bash/deps.x86_64: o/lib/ncurses/installed.x86_64 o/lib/readline/installed.x86_64
o/cli/bash/deps.aarch64: o/lib/ncurses/installed.aarch64 o/lib/readline/installed.aarch64
```

We can write:

```Makefile
BASH_DEPS := lib/ncurses lib/readline
$(eval $(call SPECIFY_DEPS,cli/bash,$(BASH_DEPS)))
```

Instead of writing:

```Makefile
BASH_CONFIG_ARGS = --disable-static --prefix=$(COSMOS)
o/cli/bash/configured.x86_64: CONFIG_COMMAND = ../../bash*/configure $(BASH_CONFIG_ARGS)
o/cli/bash/configured.aarch64: CONFIG_COMMAND = ../../bash*/configure $(BASH_CONFIG_ARGS)
```

We can write:

```Makefile
# note the $$
BASH_CONFIG_ARGS = --disable-static --prefix=$$(COSMOS)
$(eval $(call DOWNLOAD_SOURCE,cli/bash,$(BASH_CONFIG_ARGS),$(BASH_CONFIG_ARGS)))
```

## How much can be customized?

Each step allows us to run a shell script
(`DL_COMMAND`/`PATCH_COMMAND`/`CONFIG_COMMAND`/`BUILD_COMMAND`/`INSTALL_COMMAND`/`FATTEN_COMMAND`)
so we could set any these variables to some custom shell scripts when writing
the `BUILD.mk`. We could also define new targets between the ones we have in
case there is some custom build behavior. 

Important things to remember:

- Shell scripts for download/patch won't have access to any environment
  variables like `$COSMOS` (maybe they should).
- Shell scripts for configure/build/install will have access to environment
  variables in `config/vars-x86_64` or `config/vars-aarch64`
- the `FATTEN_COMMAND` shell script will have access to environment variables in
  `config/vars-fat`.
- Override the `_COMMAND` variables, don't override the `_DEFAULT` variables!
- avoid putting overly long commands inside a Makefile, write it in a shell
  script instead.

Here are some examples:

- `cli/berry/BUILD.mk` clones from a git repo, so we can change the `DL_COMMAND`
  for the `o/cli/berry/downloaded` target to do a `git clone` instead of `wget`.
- `cli/berry/BUILD.mk` also has a slightly different patch, so we can change the
  `PATCH_COMMAND` to be `patch -p1 -i` and `PATCH_FILE` to be the usual file.
- `lib/pcre` and `lib/libyaml` need to run `autoconf` or something on the
  source, so we define a `o/lib/pcre/setup` target that runs before the
  configure and handle that there.
- `web/git/BUILD.mk` does the entire build+install via `CONFIG_COMMAND =
  $(BASELOC)/web/git/config-wrapper`, because the git build requires the `LIBS`
  environment variable to be set properly. Note the `BUILD_COMMAND` and
  `INSTALL_COMMAND` variables are set to `$(DUMMYLINK0)`.
- The `BUILD_COMMAND` and `INSTALL_COMMAND` variables being set to
  `$(DUMMYLINK0)` is quite common.
- `editor/emacs`, `compiler/x86_64-gcc`, and `web/git` set `FATTEN_COMMAND` to
  their custom `fatten` script.
- `FATTEN_COMMAND` being set to `$(DUMMYLINK0)` is also common for the entries
  in `lib`.
- `lib/certs/BUILD.mk` is not a software build at all -- almost everything is a
  `$(DUMMYLINK0)` and the only thing that happens is that SSL certs are copied
  into the right spot in `/zip`.

## TODOs and TBDs

- Can we avoid relative paths everywhere, and use `$(BASELOC)/absolute/path`
  wherever needed?
- What to do about environment variables? How do we control total number of
  processes?
- What other Makefile functions will be useful? Can the functions be better?
- Switching between makefile vs shell gets a bit confiusing. How much should be
  inside a Makefile, and how much should be inside a shell script?
- How easy is it to add Cosmopolitan Libc's `zipobj` to ncurses/openssl
  builds and reduce customization in `FATTEN_COMMAND`?
- How easy is it to add Cosmopolitan Libc's `pledge` to each build?
- Can we write a tool to generate these `BUILD.mk` files for more packages? (a
  cookiecutter template type of thing)
